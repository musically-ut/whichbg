# WhichBG

***Locate your OSX wallpapers.***

[Download the app](https://github.com/musically-ut/whichbg/blob/master/app/WhichBG.app.zip?raw=true)

I have configured my Mac to rotate wallpapers images from a folder. Occasionally, it turns up an image I don't find tasteful and would like to remove from my collection. However, the folder contains thousands of images and the filenames are of the form `176 - kXFhuJJ.png`, i.e., not very informative. This leaves me no (easy) way to look for these images.

This is where this app comes in. Upon execution, it sits quietly in the taskbar. When I click on it, it shows thumbnails of all the _potentially_ active wallpapers and some more. It overestimates the list by including all wallpapers which are destined for screens which are not attached as well. When one thumbnail from the list is selected, it opens that wallpaper in a finder window.
